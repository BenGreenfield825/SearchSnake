- The body of the snake (minus the head) should be counted as "walls." Whatever system holds the info for the snake's
  body needs to compute the grid location for each body piece (each square) and send this info to the search
  algorithms.

- The only new walls that will appear when the snake moves to get the next food will be directly behind him - should
  we only feed the snake the wall locations once per new food appearance? Do we need to update as we go since some walls
  will disappear? (the tail end of the snake will move walls, a new path could theoretically appear as the snake moves)
